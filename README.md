# [Animate Your Site With AngularJS][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Animation is no longer an optional feature in web applications. Users expect it, and so we as developers must oblige. If you're writing an AngularJS-based application, then you already have a wealth of built-in animation tools available. These tools will eliminate a lot of the hard work that normally comes along with animating a web app. 

In this course, Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will teach you about about AngularJS 1.4's revamped `ngAnimate`, the module responsible for animation. `ngAnimate` is built on CSS3 animations, so you'll learn a lot about those along the way. To demonstrate the power of these technologies, for the course project Jeremy will extend the SoundCloud application to incorporate animated UI elements.
